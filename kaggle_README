Problem Description

Given a list of presents, pack them in Santa's sleigh as compactly as possible and in the best order possible.

The sleigh and presents are discretized and described in units of the fundamental length unit ℓ. The sleigh is 1000 x 1000 with infinite vertical extent as needed by your highest placed present. The cells of the sleigh go from 1 to 1000 for the length and width, and 1 to infinity in height.

Presents come in random sizes and are represented by their extent in the x, y, and z dimensions. Each present has a PresentId, a number which determines the order in which it is to be delivered. Ideally, Present 1 is to be delivered first, Present 2 second, etc. 

PresentId,Dimension1,Dimension2,Dimension3
1,2,5,3
2,243,207,73

Present 1 is 2 x 5 x 3 ℓ3 and Present 2 is 243 x 207 x 73 ℓ3. Presents can be packed in any orientation provided they are parallel and perpendicular to the x-y-z axes, meaning they can be rotated in any direction by multiples of 90∘ but not, for example, by 60∘. 

Please see the evaluation page to learn how your packing configurations will be scored and for the submission file schema.
